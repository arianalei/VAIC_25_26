# JetsonWebDashboard - Web Dashboard Interface

This directory contains the VEX AI Web Dashboard, a React-based web application that provides a real-time interface for monitoring and configuring the VEX AI vision processing system. The dashboard connects to the Jetson Nano or Raspberry Pi 5 via WebSocket to display camera feeds, detection data, system statistics, and configuration options.

## Overview

The VEX AI Web Dashboard provides a comprehensive interface for:

- **Real-time Camera Visualization**: Live color and depth camera feeds from the Intel RealSense D435 camera
- **Detection Overlay**: Visual representation of detected objects with bounding boxes and confidence scores
- **Field Visualization**: Interactive 2D top-down view of the competition field showing robot position and detected objects
- **System Statistics**: Real-time performance metrics (FPS, inference time, CPU temperature, runtime, GPS connection status)
- **Configuration Management**: Adjust GPS offset, camera offset, and HSV color correction values in real-time
- **Multi-view Support**: Switch between different views (field-only, camera-only, combined views)

The dashboard communicates with the vision processing system (`V5Web.py` in JetsonExample) via WebSocket on port 3030, and the web application is served via HTTP on port 3000.

## Architecture

### Communication Protocol

The dashboard uses WebSocket (WS) for real-time bidirectional communication:

- **WebSocket Server**: Runs on the Jetson/Raspberry Pi via `V5Web.py` (port 3030)
- **WebSocket Client**: React application connects to `ws://10.42.0.1:3030` (or device IP)
- **HTTP Server**: Static files served via `serve` on port 3000
- **Polling**: Dashboard polls for data at 60ms intervals (configurable)

### Data Flow

1. **WebSocket Connection**: Dashboard establishes WebSocket connection to Jetson/Raspberry Pi
2. **Data Requests**: Dashboard sends command requests (`g_pos`, `g_detect`, `g_color`, `g_depth`, `g_stats`)
3. **Data Response**: Server responds with requested data (JSON format)
4. **Real-time Updates**: Dashboard updates UI with received data
5. **Configuration Changes**: Dashboard sends offset/color correction updates, which apply immediately

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **UI Components**: Material-UI (MUI) v5
- **Canvas Rendering**: Konva (for field visualization)
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **Build Tool**: React Scripts (Create React App)
- **HTTP Server**: `serve` (static file serving)

## Prerequisites

### Using Pre-built Image (No Setup Required)

If you're using a pre-built SD card image, the web dashboard is **already built and configured**. The system automatically:

- Builds the React application
- Serves the static files via `serve` on port 3000
- Starts the WebSocket server on port 3030
- Configures the device to run on boot

You can skip the build setup and go directly to [Accessing the Dashboard](#accessing-the-dashboard).

### Building from Source

If you built your system from source, you'll need to set up the web dashboard manually:

**Required Software:**
- Node.js (version 16 recommended)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- `serve` package (for serving static files)

**Platform Requirements:**
- Jetson Nano or Raspberry Pi 5 with internet connection
- Wi-Fi adapter (for access point functionality)

## Setup Instructions (For Building from Source)

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using a pre-built SD card image, you can skip this section. The dashboard is already built and configured.

### Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

**Install Node.js and npm:**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
```

**Upgrade to Node.js 16 (recommended):**
```bash
sudo npm cache clean -f
sudo npm install -g n
sudo n 16
```

**Install serve package:**
```bash
sudo npm install -g serve
```

> [!TIP]
> The `n` package allows you to easily switch between Node.js versions. Node.js 16 is recommended for compatibility with the React application.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

**Navigate to the web dashboard directory:**
```bash
cd ~/VAIC_25_26/JetsonWebDashboard/vexai-web-dashboard-react
```

**Install npm packages:**
```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required dependencies listed in `package.json`, including React, Redux, Material-UI, Konva, and other dependencies.

### Step 3: Build the Application

**Build the React application:**
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `build/` directory. The build process:
- Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
- Bundles and minifies JavaScript and CSS
- Optimizes assets
- Creates a production-ready static file set

**Build Time:** The build process typically takes 1-3 minutes depending on your hardware.

### Step 4: Serve the Application

**Start the HTTP server:**
```bash
serve -s build
```

This starts a static file server serving the built application. The server will:
- Listen on port 3000 (default)
- Serve the React application
- Handle routing for the React Router

**Alternative:** To serve on a different port:
```bash
serve -s build -l 3000
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `-s` flag enables single-page application (SPA) mode, which is required for React Router to work correctly.

### Step 5: Access the Dashboard

Once the server is running, you can access the dashboard:

- **Local Access**: If viewing from the Jetson/Raspberry Pi desktop, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/#/`
- **Network Access**: If connecting via Wi-Fi access point, navigate to `http://10.42.0.1:3000/#/`

See [Accessing the Dashboard](#accessing-the-dashboard) for detailed connection instructions.

## Accessing the Dashboard

### Setting Up Wi-Fi Access Point

To access the dashboard wirelessly from another device (laptop, tablet, phone), configure your Jetson Nano or Raspberry Pi as a Wi-Fi access point (hotspot).

> [!NOTE]
> Raspberry Pi 5 users should refer to the [PiInstructions.md](../JetsonImages/PiInstructions.md) for command-line hotspot setup. The GUI method below is primarily for Jetson Nano.
